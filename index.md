### ¡Ciao, hi, hej and hola!
I'm Arianna ([`PronType=Prs|Number=Sing|Gender=Fem`](https://universaldependencies.org/u/feat/index.html)) and I'm an aspiring computational linguist.

### Long story short
###### (if you want the boring version, take a look at my [CV](https://github.com/harisont/cv/raw/master/cv.pdf))
I grew up in [Perugia](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/42278#map=11/43.1399/12.3691), where I spent my teen years using my language skills to hide my total lack of mathematical knowledge.
After graduating high school, I figured I'd ~~punish~~ challenge myself and enroll in a Computer Science program. which against all odds I ended up completing and thoroughly enjoying, both mostly thanks to great company.
During this process, I accidentally re-discovered language through a course on compilers and, without even realizing it, I had moved to [Gothenburg](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/25930131) together with my former _sambo_[^1] [K.](https://harisont.github.io/kappanneu/).
While I was telling myself and everyone else that I was there for a two-year Master's in Language Technology, it's been over 5 years and I'm still here: after graduation and a short but fun time at [Digital Grammars](https://www.digitalgrammars.com/), I embarked in the even longer-term project of a PhD in Natural Language Processing. 

I'm currently a _dottorandessa_[^2] at [Språkbanken Text](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/), under the supervision of [Elena Volodina](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/om/personal/elena) and [Dana Dannélls](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/om/personal/dana).
My main areas of interest are __computational syntax__ and __Computer-Assisted Language Learning__, with a focus on L2 grammar acquisition.
Currently, I am working on tools for parallel treebanks and parsing learner essays.

[^1]: [Swedish] _sam_ ("with") + _bo_ ("live") = cohabitating partner
[^2]: [Italian] the feminine form of the word _dottorando_ ("PhD student"), at least according to my mom.
