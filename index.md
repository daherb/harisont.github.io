Hi and welcome to my chaotically multilingual blog! 

Parlo __italiano__ come prima lingua, I find it easiest to write technical texts in __English__, jag bor i Göteborg och försöker hela tiden förbättra min __svenska__, pero el idioma que me hace sentir más feliz siempre ha sido el __español__. 

Even though my [Master's thesis](https://github.com/harisont/concept-alignment) was in Machine Translation, I like translating stuff myself too, and it is my ambition to write all the content of this blog in English + 1 (as a side effect, that would make a nice set of parallel texts). But more realistically, get ready for a bunch of texts in broken `*ish`¹ where the language is chosen based on topic, mood and audience but also less relevant factor such as place and time of writing.

¹ the only language whose name doesn't end in -ish should be alright, I hope.

# Other projects
...because having a separate homepage takes too much effort, in case that wasn't obvious.

## Software
- [__me-tadah__](https://github.com/harisont/me-tadah), the simplest possible ebook metadata editor. Definitely the most useful piece of software I've ever written
- [__Rick Lime__](https://github.com/harisont/rick-lime), a silly chatbot that helps you write limericks
- [__Librery__](https://github.com/harisont/Librery), the only Android app I've ever written all by myself from beginning to end

## Misc
- __Impara l'Haskell e mettilo da parte__, a basic [video Haskell course](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6fKcYGimkXYd-N5ryesKqw) in Italian with tons of [code examples](https://github.com/harisont/imparalhaskell) (slowly in progress)
- [__Postcards from Gothenburg__](https://harisont.github.io/postcards-from-gothenburg/), my only vaguely coherent photography project in about 15 years of photography
