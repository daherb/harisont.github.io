## ¡Ciao, hi, hej and hola!
My name is Arianna, on the internet `@harisont`.

I've always been really into language(s) and education, but recklessly decided to ~~torture~~ challenge myself and got into my hometown's [Computer Science Bachelor's programme](https://www.dmi.unipg.it/en/courses/computer-science-courses/bachelor-s-degree-in-computer-science). 
Against all odds, I ended up loving the subject but couldn't resist moving to Sweden for my Master's to be able to also take a few NLP courses at the [University of Gothenburg](https://www.gu.se/).
After graduating with a [thesis in Machine Translation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harisont/concept-alignment/master/thesis/final_report/synbased_ca_for_mt.pdf), I worked as a __software developer at [Digital Grammars](https://www.digitalgrammars.com/)__ and I'm currently a __PhD student in Language Technology at [Språkbanken](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/)__, where I'm finally closing the circle working on developing tools for Computer-Assisted Language Learning.

My other interests include Second Language Acquisition, Controlled Natural Languages, grammar engineering, dependency parsing, dialogue systems, compilers and functional programming, but also Free and Open Source Software, Android development, [photography](https://harisont.github.io/postcards-from-gothenburg/), a cappella singing, podcasting, [writing](blog.md), board gaming, biking, inline skating and rock climbing.
