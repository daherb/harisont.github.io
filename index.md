### ¡Ciao, hi, hej and hola!
My name is Arianna, I'm an aspiring computational linguist and my pronouns are `PronType=Prs|Number=Sing|Gender=Fem`[^1].


### Long story short
I grew up in [Perugia](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/42278#map=11/43.1399/12.3691) thinking I was good at learning languages but very bad at counting.
Nonetheless, after high school I figured I'd ~~torture~~ challenge myself and study Computer Science.
Against all odds, mostly thanks to [great company](https://github.com/orgs/dis-org/people), I managed to get a Bachelor's degree and fall in love with the subject in the meantime.
I re-discovered language by taking a course about compilers and suddenly found myself in [Gothenburg](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/25930131) together with my [then-_sambo_ K.](https://harisont.github.io/kappanneu/)[^2], studying Language Technology. Immediately after that, I spent some months working at a local language technology company, [Digital Grammars](https://www.digitalgrammars.com/). Despite that being a lot of fun, I soon went back to university, where I'm currently a _dottorandessa_[^3] at [Språkbanken Text](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/).

### Stuff I do, did, will and don't
When I'm not writing [papers](research.md#publications), I scribble [random blog posts and silly rhymes](blog.md) in various languages.<br>
When I'm not working on my [PhD project software](https://github.com/harisont/L2-UD), I try to maintain a number of more-or-less useless [open source tools](projects.md#software).<br>
When I'm not teaching in a classroom, I procrastinate on completing my [basic Haskell online course](projects.md#tutorials). 

Following a bad breakup with [a cappella singing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaMoZsXScj0), I've had a series of on-and-off, noncommittal affairs with various wind instruments and struggle with a love-hate relationship with music in general.
On the other hand, I'm still on pretty good terms with my first love, [photography](projects.md#photography) and have a crush on podcasting.

I can't play videogames, but I take certain board games very seriously.<br>
Team sports make me cry, but I really love running, rock climbing and all sorts of human-powered wheeled vehicles.
I can't stand fantasy, but I welcome tips about books and comics within any other genre.
I never lasted longer than six episodes of a TV series, but I'm always up for a good movie (even more so if it's animated and weird).
I really, really, _really_ hate phone calls, but I always answer [email](mailto:arianna.masciolini@gmail.com) (eventually).

[^2]: [Swedish]: _sam_ ("with") + _bo_ ("live") = cohabitating partner
[^3]: [Italian]: feminine form of the word _dottorando_ ("PhD student"), at least according to my mom. I suspect there is some irony involved.
