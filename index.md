## ¡Ciao, hi, hej and hola!
My name is __Arianna Masciolini__, on the internet __harisont__.

I've always been really into language(s) and education, but after graduating from a humanities-oriented high school I decided to ~~torture~~ challenge myself and study Computer Science at the local university in my hometown, Perugia. 
Against all odds, I ended up getting my Bachelor's degree and actually loving the subject, but a course called Formal Languages and Compilers reminded me of my love for language and all of a sudden I found myself in Gothenburg specializing in Computational Linguistics.
During that time, I developed a particular interest for grammar engineering, dependency parsing and dialogue systems.

After graduating, I stayed and work as a software developer at [Digital Grammars](https://www.digitalgrammars.com/), but a year later I went back to university, where I'm currently employed as a PhD student in Language Technology at [Språkbanken Text](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/).
Here, I'm finally closing the circle working on developing tools for Computer-Assisted Language Learning.

In my spare time, I enjoy writing both text and code. 
I have [multilingual blog](blog.md) and a growing number of little [open source projects](https://github.com/harisont). 
When it comes to programming, I often find Python practical but I'm a lot happier when I get to use Haskell or Kotlin. 
I've also done and plan on keep doing a lot of photography, a cappella singing and rock climbing. 
In the future, I dream of making a podcast and master a musical instrument. 

Unlike most other nerds, I generally dislike video games, TV series, and RPGs, but I can get very enthusiastic about books and comics of any kind, board games that don't take hours to play and all human-powered vehicles with wheels.

### Practicalities

- __preferred communication channel__: [email](mailto:arianna.masciolini@gmail.com). That applies even if you have my phone number
- __pronouns__: she/her, but I'll be fine with whatever is singular animate
- __curriculum vitae__: [download the PDF](https://github.com/harisont/cv/raw/master/cv.pdf)
