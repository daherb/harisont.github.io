### ¡Ciao, hi, hej and hola!
My name is __Arianna Masciolini__, on the internet __harisont__.
People address me as she/her, but my only preference is for singular animate pronouns. 

I've always been really into language(s) and education, but after graduating from a heavily humanities-oriented high school I decided to ~~torture~~ challenge myself and study Computer Science at the local university in my hometown, Perugia. 
Against all odds, I ended up getting my Bachelor's degree and actually loving the subject, but a course called Formal Languages and Compilers reminded me of my love for language and all of a sudden I was in Gothenburg specializing in Computational Linguistics.
After graduating, I decided to stay and work as a software developer at [Digital Grammars](https://www.digitalgrammars.com/), my Master's thesis supervisor's language technology company. 
That was a lot of fun, but a year later I went back to university, where I'm currently employed as a PhD student in Language Technology at [Språkbanken Text](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/).
Here, I'm finally closing the circle working with Computer-Assisted Language Learning.

When I'm not [working](research.md), I enjoy writing even more text and even more code. 
I have [multilingual blog](blog.md) and a growing number of little [open source projects](projects.md#software). 
There's a lot of a cappella singing in my past and I'd love to make a popular science podcast in the future.
I'm also really into [photography](projects.md#photography), reading, weird animated movies, board games, rock climbing and all sorts of human-powered wheeled vehicles. 

I tend to hate video games, TV series and phone calls, so please [email me instead](mailto:arianna.masciolini@gmail.com)!
