# Other projects

## Software
- [__me-tadah__](https://github.com/harisont/me-tadah), the simplest possible ebook metadata editor. Definitely the most useful piece of software I've ever written
- [__Rick Lime__](https://github.com/harisont/rick-lime), a silly chatbot that helps you write limericks
- [__Librery__](https://github.com/harisont/Librery), the only Android app I've ever written all by myself from beginning to end

## Misc
- __Impara l'Haskell e mettilo da parte__, a basic [video Haskell course](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6fKcYGimkXYd-N5ryesKqw) in Italian with tons of [code examples](https://github.com/harisont/imparalhaskell) (slowly in progress)
- [__Postcards from Gothenburg__](https://harisont.github.io/postcards-from-gothenburg/), my only vaguely coherent photography project in about 15 years of photography. It's also my best effort building a website from scratch
