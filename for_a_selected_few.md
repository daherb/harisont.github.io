If you a member of one of my _ristretti circoli_ยน, I might have given you a password. 
Choose the relevant circle and follow the corresponding link to access what I told you I was going to give you access to.

- If you are __me__, [click here](https://harisont.github.io/area-riservata/)
- if you are __a close friend of mine__ and you know there's a particular text I want you to read, [click here](https://harisont.github.io/pronouns/)
- if you are one of my __thesis supervisors__, [click here]()

If you don't have a password but think you deserve it, feel free to [contact me](mailto:arianna.masciolini@gmail.com).
