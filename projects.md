## Software
- [__me-tadah__](https://github.com/harisont/me-tadah), the simplest possible ebook metadata editor. Definitely the most useful piece of software I've ever written
- [__Rick Lime__](https://github.com/harisont/rick-lime), a silly chatbot that helps you write limericks. Definitely the least useful piece of software I've ever written
- [__conllu-plus-converter__](https://github.com/harisont/conllu-plus-converter), a simple conversion tool for [CoNNL-U (Plus) files](https://universaldependencies.org/format.html)
- [__Librery__](https://github.com/harisont/Librery), the first and probably last complete Android app I'll ever have the patience to write all by myself
- [__arr√®__](https://github.com/harisont/arre), a collection of Python scripts to download and transcribe recordings of trials from the Radio Radicale archives. Hastily written for my mom and cousin who actually haven't really gotten a real chance to use it yet

### LaTeX themes & templates
- [__lucid__](https://github.com/harisont/lucid), the beamer theme I use for 100% of my presentations since 2018, recently revamped
- [__GUnofficial-poster-template__](https://github.com/harisont/GUnofficial-poster-template), the template I'm using for my academic posters

## Tutorials
About two years ago, I started working on __Impara l'Haskell e mettilo da parte__, a basic [video Haskell course](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6fKcYGimkXYd-N5ryesKqw) with tons of [code examples](https://github.com/harisont/imparalhaskell).
The course is entirely in Italian, as the goal was to create learning materials easily accessible to my fellow citizens that take their little familiarity English as an excuse not to learn what I think is the very best programming language out there.

I had to take a long break from this project, but I'm trying to get back to it right now!

## Photography
[__Postcards from Gothenburg__](https://harisont.github.io/postcards-from-gothenburg/) is my only vaguely coherent photography project in about 15 years of photography. It's also a very good way to showcase my poor web development skills. 

I very sporadically post stuff on Instagram as [@unottica](https://www.instagram.com/unottica/) too.
