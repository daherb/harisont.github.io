# Personal projects

## Software
- [__Librery__](https://github.com/harisont/Librery), the only Android app I've ever written all by myself from beginning to end
- [__me-tadah__](https://github.com/harisont/me-tadah), the simplest possible ebook metadata editor. Definitely the most useful piece of software I've ever written
- [__Rick Lime__](https://github.com/harisont/rick-lime), a silly chatbot that helps you write limericks. Definitely the least useful piece of software I've ever written
- [__conllu-plus-converter__](https://github.com/harisont/conllu-plus-converter), a simple conversion tool for [CoNNL-U (Plus) files](https://universaldependencies.org/format.html)
- [__arr√©__](https://github.com/harisont/arre), my summer 2022 holiday NLP project: a collection of Python scripts to download and transcribe recordings of trials from the Radio Radicale archives. Made with love and hastle for my mom and cousin. 

## Tutorials
Over a year ago, I started working on __Impara l'Haskell e mettilo da parte__, a basic [video Haskell course](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6fKcYGimkXYd-N5ryesKqw) with tons of [code examples](https://github.com/harisont/imparalhaskell).
The course is entirely in Italian, as the goal was to create learning materials easily accessible to my fellow citizens that take their little familiarity English as an excuse not to learn what I think is the very best programming language out there.

I was forced to take a long break from this project, but I hope to get back to it soon!

## Photography
[__Postcards from Gothenburg__](https://harisont.github.io/postcards-from-gothenburg/) is my only vaguely coherent photography project in about 15 years of photography. It's also my best effort building a website from scratch. 

I'm also very sporadically posting on instagram as [@unottica](https://www.instagram.com/unottica/).
