title: About me
---

I have a strong interest in software and language(s), with a special preference for functional programming and grammars.

I've worked as a software developer at [Digital Grammars](https://www.digitalgrammars.com/) and I'm currently a doctoral student in Computational Linguistics at [Spr√•kbanken](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/).

In my free time, you might find me walking around with a camera, reading, writing, listening to music and podcasts, playing board games, trying to write open source Android apps, biking or rock climbing.
