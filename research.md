I'm currently trying to develop ICALL tools to help learners develop their written production skills.

### Past projects

#### Concept alignment (Master's thesis project)
The aim of this project was to develop a tool for bootstrapping translation lexica for grammar-based domain-specific MT systems.
The resulting system generates [GF](https://www.grammaticalframework.org/) multilingual grammar fragments by aligning parallel [UD](https://universaldependencies.org/) treebanks, which can be automatically parsed from parallel texts, to extract word and phrase level correspondences.
