I'm currently doing a PhD in Language Technology at [Språkbanken Text](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/) ([University of Gothenburg](https://www.gu.se/)), where I'm supervised by [Elena Volodina](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/om/personal/elena) and [Dana Dannélls](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/om/personal/dana).

My main area of interest is __Computer-Assisted Language Learning__, with a focus on __L2 grammar acquisition__.
I'm currently working on developing tools to analyze grammatical error patterns in learner corpora. 

I am very enthusiastic about interlingual approaches and particularly enjoy working with [Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org/) and [Grammatical Framework](grammaticalframework.org/).
