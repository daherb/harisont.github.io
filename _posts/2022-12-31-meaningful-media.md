This post, heavily inspired by Nicky Case's yearly meaningful media lists, such as [this one from 2019](https://blog.ncase.me/my-most-meaningful-media-of-2019/), is a selection of the books, comics, articles, movies, videos and other media I enjoyed during this past year.

Because this blog is chaotic and multilingual, the list is simply in chronological order and the language in which each item is written in usually depends on the language in which I consumed the content. 

1. _Gender Queer_, an autobiographical graphic novel by wonderful [Maia Kobabe](https://redgoldsparkspress.com/about). The volume is based on the author's webcomics originally published on [eir Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/redgoldsparks/) and some excerpts from the actual book are available [here](https://redgoldsparkspress.com/projects/6926504), but I really recommend that you read the whole thing.

2. _Martin Eden_, un'adattamento cinematografico italiano dell'omonimo romanzo di Jack London
3. _Lo chiamavano Jeeg Robot_
