Have you tried to click on the Subscribe button at the bottom of this page but were scared away by a weird looking webpage full of angular braces? Keep reading. 
Do you just want to find out more about an amazing web 1.0 technology that is now more then ever needed? You've come to the right place.

## What RSS is
As you might suspect, RSS is an acronym. I've always thought it stood for Really Simple Syndication, which sounds somewhat mysterious, but while doing some research for this blog post I found two more denominations: RDF[ยน](#notes) Site Summary and Rich Site Summary. 
The latter is probably the most self-explanatory: RSS is something (to be precise, a text file, usually referred to as a _feed_, in a standardized, machine-readable format) that sums up the contents of a certain website.

If you've ever opened an RSS feed (you can try [right now](https://harisont.github.io/feed.xml)), you've probably noticed that "machine-readable" doesn't provide us humans with a pleasing reading experience. In fact, we aren't supposed to _read_ RSS feeds directly: we're supposed to _subscribe_ to them and have a program (literally a _feed reader_) present them in a nicer way.

## Why RSS is falling into oblivion
Back in the late 90s, when RSS was invented, subscribing to RSS feeds was a _Really Simple_, if not The Simplest way to get updates from a webpage: you had to download a feed reader, give it the URLs of a bunch of interested RSS feeds and you were good to go - you'd never miss an update or get distracted by content you hadn't explicitly opted into. Sounds like a dream? Well, it's reality, or at least it used to be: until recently, RSS was everywhere: news sites, blogs and all sorts of frequently updated webpages would have an RSS feed. Podcasts were all distributed through RSS. Even YouTube, when it came into being, had RSS feeds ready for you to subscribe to (spoiler: it still has them, but they never made you notice).

## How to RSS
TODO: you need a feed and a reader (with sw recommendations: AntennaPod, Fluent Reader, something from F-droid...) 

### Find all the feeds
TODO: extension for hidden feeds

## Extra: but how does an RSS feed look like?
TODO: so far, conceptual model (digression). Now, let's look at this blog's feed (analyze xml).

## Extra: OPML files
TODO: explain, include mine (podcasts and blogs)

## Extra: how to make your own feed
