As every aspiring computational linguist on this planet, I've been playing with ChatGTP.
While I'm not tremendously impressed with ChatGTP's answers on any slightly-less-than-straightforward questions with verifiable answers, asking it to do something that requires some creativity occasionally results in a display of a mixture of genuinely fun ideas and absolute incapacity to make good use of any of them in a coherent text.
So, I decided we should try to cooperate on writing a silly poem like the ones I sometimes post on this blog.
The result is what you see here below:

### Navigating the Academic Landscape: Choosing Between Conference and Journal Papers
Conference or journal, which way to go?<br>
Let's see the differences, row after row.

A conference paper is short and concise,<br>
Meant for the event, with less time to revise.<br>
With results preliminary, work sill ongoing,<br>
It gives you a chance for networking and showing.

What lands on a journal's in-depth and refined,<br>
Detailed and polished, with printing in mind.<br>
It's subject to long reviews, usually blind,<br>
And ends up more visible, easier to find.

So, conference or journal, which one to go for?<br>
Choosing's on you now that you know more.<br>
Both are of value in their own unique way,<br>
So just pick the one that fits best today.


## The process
It all started with a relatively straightforward question I decided to ask ChatGTP:

> __harisont:__ What is the difference between conference and journal publications?

As expected, I got one of ChatGPT's typical long, plain, but otherwise fine answers:

> __ChatGTP:__ Conference and journal publications are both important ways to share research findings with a wider audience, but there are some key differences between the two.
>
> A conference publication is typically a paper or abstract that is presented at a conference or other academic event. Conference publications are usually shorter and more concise than journal articles, and may be more focused on preliminary findings or work in progress. Conference papers are often presented in a brief presentation or poster session, and the author may have the opportunity to discuss their work with other attendees.
>
>In contrast, a journal publication is a more in-depth and polished version of a research study that has been submitted and accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Journal articles are typically longer and more detailed than conference papers, and may be subject to more rigorous review and editing processes. Journal articles also tend to be more permanent and widely available than conference papers, as they are typically published online and/or in print and are often indexed by scholarly databases for easy access and citation.
>
>Another key difference between conference and journal publications is the time frame in which they are published. Conference papers are often presented at events that occur on a specific date, while journal articles can be submitted and published at any time, and can be read and cited by scholars years after their initial publication.
>
>In summary, conference publications are shorter, more preliminary versions of research findings that are presented at academic events, while journal publications are more polished, detailed, and permanent versions of research studies that have been submitted and accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

At this point, I asked ChatGTP to give me the same answer in rhymes, and it produced this:

> __ChatGTP:__ <br>
> Conference or journal, which way to go?<br>
> Let's see the differences, rhyme by rhyme, row by row.<br>
> 
> A conference publication is short and concise,<br>
> Presented at events with less time to revise.<br>
> It may be preliminary or work in progress,<br>
> But it's a chance to network and discuss.
> 
> A journal article is in-depth and refined,<br>
> Polished and detailed with a more permanent design.<br>
> It's subject to rigorous review and editing,<br>
> And widely available for scholars' reading.
> 
> Conference papers are presented at a specific time,<br>
> While journal articles can be read years down the line.<br>
> The former may be more focused on preliminary finds,<br>
> While the latter presents more developed designs.
> 
> So, conference or journal, which one to choose?<br>
> It depends on the study and the path you want to pursue.<br>
> Both are valuable in their unique way,<br>
> So choose the one that fits best today.

It's not _very_ good, but it's not _too_ bad either. <br>
The second verse is too long, but other than that I quite like the opening.
The meaning, and even the structure, of the answer in prose is more or less preserved.
There is some actual rhyming, some things that look like rhyming (cf. _progress/discuss_), and some other that sound more or less the same (cf. _choose/pursue_).
The division into stanzas is perfectly logical, and I even like that equal space is given to defining conference papers and journal articles. 
The fourth stanza seems a bit useless, but the closing, apart from another disproportionately long verse, is cool, especially the part where ChatGPT addresses the reader.

The main problem is the metric. 
The poem _looks_ like something that should have some rhythm to it, but even if I tried to read it out loud as best as I could, but there's no way I can make it work. 
This is my best attempt:

I think the second verse is too long. Can you remove "rhyme by rhyme"?

Conference or journal, which way to go?
Let's see the differences, row by row.

A conference publication is short and concise,
Presented at events with less time to revise.
It may be preliminary or work in progress,
But it's a chance to network and discuss.

A journal article is in-depth and refined,
Polished and detailed with a more permanent design.
It's subject to rigorous review and editing,
And widely available for scholars' reading.

Conference papers are presented at a specific time,
While journal articles can be read years down the line.
The former may be more focused on preliminary finds,
While the latter presents more developed designs.

So, conference or journal, which one to choose?
It depends on the study and the path you want to pursue.
Both are valuable in their unique way,
So choose the one that fits best today.

"Progress" does not rhyme with "discuss". The accent is different. Can you find some better replacement for the latter?

uzkamascio@gmail.com
so YOU choose

I'm sorry if my previous response wasn't helpful. As an AI language model, I cannot make decisions for you. Choosing whether to submit a paper to a conference or a journal depends on various factors such as the purpose of your study, the stage of your research, and your career goals. You will need to consider these factors and make an informed decision based on your individual circumstances.
uzkamascio@gmail.com
nono that was meant as a small change to make in the poem

Oh, I see! My apologies for the confusion. Here's the revised version:

That's not the change I was asking for, but I like the verb "pick". Let's change the last verse to "So you pick the one that fits best today"

I apologize for the misunderstanding earlier. Here's the revised version with your requested change:

Who told you to change "pursue" to "peruse"!?

I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I misunderstood your previous message. I will make sure to pay closer attention to your requests in the future. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
uzkamascio@gmail.com
Can you switch back to pursue?

Certainly, I apologize for the confusion. Here's the revised version with "pursue" instead of "peruse":

What rhymes with "read", in this context?

In this context, you could consider using words like "spread", "shed", or "led" as a rhyme for "read". For example:

"It's subject to rigorous review and editing,
And widely available for scholars to be reading."

or

"It's subject to rigorous review and editing,
And widely available for scholars to spread."
uzkamascio@gmail.com
That does not sound good. Some proper rhymes with read?

My apologies, you are correct that "spread", "shed", and "led" do not provide a perfect rhyme for "read". Here are some other possible options for a perfect rhyme with "read":

    It's subject to rigorous review and editing,
    And widely available for scholars to be fed.

    It's subject to rigorous review and editing,
    And widely available for scholars to be led.

    It's subject to rigorous review and editing,
    And widely available for scholars to be bred.

I hope one of these options works better for your poem!
uzkamascio@gmail.com
I just want some words that rhyme with "read", I'll figure out how to change the poem myself

I apologize for misunderstanding your request earlier. Here are some words that rhyme with "read":

    Led
    Wed
    Fed
    Head
    Dread
    Bread
    Shed
    Ted
    Zed

I hope this helps!
uzkamascio@gmail.com
ok ok you don't know what rhymes are

I apologize for any confusion. Rhymes are words that have the same or similar sounds at the end of their syllables, such as "read" and "breed" or "head" and "bed". However, in poetry, some words may be used creatively to create a near rhyme or slant rhyme, where the sounds are not exactly the same but are similar enough to create a poetic effect.
uzkamascio@gmail.com
Let's divide the poem in 2-verse sections 

Sure, here's the poem divided into two sections with two verses each:

Conference or journal, which way to go?
Let's see the differences, row by row.

A conference paper is short and concise,
Meant for events with less time to revise.
It may be preliminary or work in progress,
But it's a chance to network and reassess.

A journal paper is in-depth and refined,
Polished and detailed with printing in mind,
It's subject to rigorous peer review,
And widely available for scholars to view.

Conference papers are presented at a specific time,
While journal articles can be read years down the line.
The former may be more focused on preliminary finds,
While the latter presents more developed designs.

So you pick the one that fits best today,
And let your research pave the way.
Both are of value in their own unique way,
So choose the one that suits you and seize the day.
uzkamascio@gmail.com

Would you try to translate it to Swedish?

Sure, I can provide a translation of the poem into Swedish. Here it is:

Konferens eller tidskrift, vilket val att göra?
Låt oss se skillnaderna, rad för rad att föra.
En konferensartikel är kort och kärnfull,
Ämnad för event med mindre tid att forma full.
Den kan vara preliminär eller arbete pågående,
Men ger en chans till nätverkande och framtidsgrävande.
En tidskriftsartikel är djupgående och förfinad,
Polerad och detaljerad, med tryckning i sinnet.
Den genomgår rigorös granskning av sina fynd,
Och är vida tillgänglig för forskare av alla slags rynd.
Konferensartiklar presenteras vid ett specifikt tillfälle,
Medan tidskriftsartiklar kan läsas år efter år med bättre skäl.
De förra kan fokusera mer på preliminära fynd,
Medan de senare presenterar mer utvecklade design.
Så, konferens eller tidskrift, vilket val att göra?
Det beror på studien och vilken väg du vill föra.
Båda är värdefulla på sitt eget unika sätt,
Så välj den som passar bäst idag är min uppriktiga föreskrift.
uzkamascio@gmail.com
hmmm. let's try Italian?

Sure, I can try to translate the poem into Italian. Here it is:

Conferenza o pubblicazione, quale scegliere?
Le differenze, ora, andiamo a vedere.
La conferenza è breve e concisa,
Pensata per un evento, senza troppa improvvisa.
I risultati, forse, ancora non concreti,
Ma ti offre l'opportunità di incontrare i tuoi eredi.
La pubblicazione, approfondita e raffinata,
Dettagliata e lucidata, in stampa già destinata.
Soggetta a una rigorosa recensione,
Ma visibile a tutti senza alcuna ragione.
Allora, conferenza o pubblicazione, qual è la tua scelta?
Dipende dal tuo studio e dalla tua strada in questo universo di moltitudine.
Entrambe hanno il loro valore unico,
Scegli quindi quella che si adatta meglio, in modo specifico.
uzkamascio@gmail.com
I dont like the translations. Let's go back to the original English version. Can you propose a few titles?
