# Title (test post)

This is a _test post_.

I will use this to see if [the theme I choose](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) renders everything in an __acceptable__ way.
Of course, everything can't be perfect until I customize it.

## Section (the only one)

### Subsection 1 (lists)

- a
- b
- c

1. one
2. two
3. three

### Subsection 2 (table & image)

| A | B | C |
| --- | --- | --- |
| can I bring | my friend | to tea |
| blah | blah | blah |

---

{% include image.html file="https://harisont.github.io/assets/identicon.png" description="Caption here!" %}

### Subsection 3 (code & math)
Sometimes I write code (in `monospace`) too, like

```python
print("You will syntax-highlighted, won't you?")
```

What about 

$$\LaTeX$$

$$\sum_{i=0}^{10}i$$
