Earlier this year, in late May, I travelled to the Faroe Islands with some of my colleagues to participate in the [24th Nordic Conference on Computational Linguistics](https://www.nodalida2023.fo/) in Tórshavn. 
Finding yourself in such an exotic location does not happen every day. 
So, four of us decided to stay a few more days after the conference, rent a car and explore the islands further.
In this post, I will recount our holiday mainly through my black-and-white photographs of the Faroese nature, which I try to provide some context for in text.

## Getting to the Faroes

While the Faroe Islands have a small airport on the westernmost Island, we chose to reach Tórshavn by ferry.
That took us more than a full weekend (Friday afternoon to Monday morning, making it just in time for the beginning of the conference) between travelling to Denmark and spending over two days at sea.
