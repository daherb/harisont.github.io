Earlier this year, in late May, I travelled to the Faroe Islands with some of my colleagues to participate in the [24th Nordic Conference on Computational Linguistics](https://www.nodalida2023.fo/) in Tórshavn. 
Finding yourself in such an exotic location does not happen every day. 
So, four of us decided to stay a few more days after the conference, rent a car and explore the islands further.
In this post, I will recount our holiday mainly through my black-and-white photographs of the Faroese nature, which I try to provide some context for in text.

## Getting to the Faroes

While the Faroe Islands have a small airport on the westernmost Island, we chose to reach Tórshavn by passenger ship.
Travelling to Denmark and spending over two days at sea took us more than a full weekend (Friday afternoon to Monday morning, making it just in time for the beginning of the conference). 
Travelling by ship, an experience that one of my colleagues defined "surreal", has of course its pros and cons, but is completely feasible and enjoyable for the most part.

## Tórshavn
During the conference days, I was too concentrated on absorbing information, presenting my own work and all the social interactions to care about taking good pictures, so I only have a single unexciting photo that I want to share:

With the inevitable green roof and decorative sheep[^1], the Nordic House was the conference's main venue.

[^1]: There are more sheep than people in the Faroes, and they might even be the reason why the Islands are called the way they are (see Etymology [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faroe_Islands)).
