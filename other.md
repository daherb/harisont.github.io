## Photography
I have been passionate about photography since age 8.
In the last few years, my focus has switched from individual shots to slightly more extensive projects, resulting in:

- [__Postcards from Gothenburg__](https://harisont.github.io/postcards-from-gothenburg/), a project for a summer university course and luckily the only website I've ever had to write from scratch
- [__@unottica__](https://www.instagram.com/unottica/), an abandoned attempt to find a personal style
- my ongoing __photography blog post series__:
  1. [_GB-AG: fotografie di un viaggio per mare e per terra_](https://harisont.github.io/unottica/2022/11/13/gbag.html), the black-and-white documentation of an interrail trip from Gothenburg to Agrigento (in Italian)
  2. [_Vardagsbilder_](https://harisont.github.io/unottica/2023/04/09/vardagsbilder-sv.html), a collection of pictures taken with a pocket camera over the course of March 2023 (available in Swedish and Italian)
  3. [_FÃ¸royar_](https://harisont.github.io/photography/2023/12/27/foroyar.html), a more ambitious photography project, where photographs in an interactive map are used to recount a journey to the Faroe Islands (in English)

## Reading, writing, translating
Aside from academic writing, my [__blog__](blog.md) is home to silly rhymes, comments on whatever books and comics I read and many more scribbles.
In the future, I would like to try to do more popular science content.

I have also contributed to the Italian translation of various things on the web, for instance [Nicky Case's interactive article _What happens next?_](https://harisont.github.io/covid-19/) and more recently [Karin Boye's short story _Blomningstid_](https://harisont.github.io/traduzioni/2023/08/18/blomningstid.html).

## Music
Despite a frustrating amount of failures to learn how to play a variety of musical instruments, I've been part of innumerable choirs and two smaller vocal ensembles:

- __VoxInFabula__ (2013-2018, here is a [funny video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaMoZsXScj0) I am still quite proud of)
- [__Tritonus__](https://www.youtube.com/@tritonus_ensemble/videos) (still active in Umbria, and actually proceeded to become really good immediately _after_ I moved to Sweden).

Since I can't really play any instrument as of now, I have of course also tried to instruct my computer to do that for me. [In Haskell](https://github.com/lcdsa/geb).

## Sports
I used to run quite a lot, but as of now I'm more into all sorts of human-powered wheeled vehicles.
I am also an _arrampicatrice della domenica_[^1].
